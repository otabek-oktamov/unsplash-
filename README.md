1. Please go over to https://unsplash.com/developers and grab yourself a API key
2. Copy and paste your key in the code (I left a comment on where it needs to go).
3. Run the program and search for a wallpaper (by default 9 images will appear)
4. Double click an image to open it in a new webpage. At this point you can right click and save the image.
5. Need a different wallpaper? Just search for another one.
6. Enjoy!
